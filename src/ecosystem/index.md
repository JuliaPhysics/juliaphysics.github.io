## Plotting

Visualization is one of the most important tools in our toolkit.
There are three main plotting packages in Julia:

- Plots.jl: Very intuitive and convenient, Plots.jl is a wrapper around several
  plotting backends.  Plots tries to figure out what you _want_ it to do, not
  just what you tell it.
- Makie.jl: Built around the idea of fast, interactive plotting utilizing the speed of OpenGL and the GPU (and WebGL now), Makie.jl is a next-generation plotting package which offers superior interactivity and speed.  
  It's great for building interactive or animated visualzations with minimal
  overhead, but the time to first plot is a little slow compared to Plots, and
  it isn't _quite_ as feature-complete.  Written in pure Julia.
- PyPlot.jl: A wrapper around the PyPlot interface to the popular Python
  plotting library `matplotlib`.
