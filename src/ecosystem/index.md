## Plotting

Visualization is one of the most important tools in our toolkit.
There are three main plotting packages in Julia:

- [`Plots.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl): Very intuitive and
  convenient, Plots.jl is a wrapper around several plotting backends.  Plots
  tries to figure out what you _want_ it to do, not just what you tell it.
- [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl): Built around the idea of
  fast, interactive plotting utilizing the speed of OpenGL and the GPU (and
  WebGL now), `Makie.jl` is a next-generation plotting package which offers
  superior interactivity and speed.  It's great for building interactive or
  animated visualzations with minimal overhead, but the time to first plot is a
  little slow compared to Plots, and it isn't _quite_ as feature-complete.
  Written in pure Julia.
- [`PyPlot.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl): A wrapper around the
  PyPlot interface to the popular Python plotting library `matplotlib`.
