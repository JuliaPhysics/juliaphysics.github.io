# Julia's Physics Organizations

Julia has a very lively and welcoming physics community. You shouldn't hesitate to engage with other users and package authors if you have questions or want to contribute to a project.

Among the cornerstones of our community are **Julia GitHub Groups**, also known as **Julia organizations**, which typically revolve around a particular subfields of physics and group people together in a contextual way. An overview of all Julia organizations can be found on [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/community/). Below we list Julia's physics(-related) organizations.



* [JuliaPhysics](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics) - General physics organization
* [JuliaAstro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) - Community Astronomy and Astrophysics packages for Julia
* [QuantumBFS]() - A group of quantum developers around Bao Fu Si (mainly quantum circuits)
* [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics) - A Julia organization for dynamical systems
* [JuliaGeo](https://github.com/JuliaGeo) - Geoscience organization
* [JuliaDiffEq](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq) - An organization for differential equations in Julia
