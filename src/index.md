# JuliaPhysics

Welcome to the homepage of the JuliaPhysics, your entry point into the physics community of Julia.

On the following web pages we try to give you an effortless introduction into using Julia for physics. Among others, we provide you with

* an overview of physics-related packages in the ecosystem,
* tutorials and snippets,
* information about how to connect to the community.

Julia has a large ecosystem of packages built around scientific computing. In the section [Ecosystem](ecosystem) we've aimed to give an overview of packages in the ecosystem that can be useful for physical computing.

JuliaPhysics itself hosts several packages, as well. You can find a comprehensive list on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/juliaphysics).
