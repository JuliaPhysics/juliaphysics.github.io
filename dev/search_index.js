Plots tries to figure out what you want it to do, not just what you tell it.\nMakie.jl   Built around the idea of fast, interactive plotting utilizing the speed of OpenGL and the GPU (and WebGL now), Makie.jl is a next-generation plotting package which offers superior interactivity and speed.     It's great for building interactive or animated visualzations with minimal overhead, but the time to first plot is a little slow compared to Plots, and it isn't quite as feature-complete.
